# Final Mini-Project

## Description

Create a Jupyter notebook that graphs out data from a data set. This notebook should describe the analyses that you're doing on this data set along with at least 4 graphs. You may also combine multiple data sets when creating your project notebook. The data should be stored in a file and read in by your notebook.

## Deliverables

* The Jupyter notebook file containing the graphing code. This notebook file should also contain a URL linking to the page where this data source comes from.
* One or more files that are being analyzed.

## Suggestions

You may use any publically available data source that can be found on the web. Some places you might be able to find data include:
